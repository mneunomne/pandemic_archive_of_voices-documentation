- installtion shot showing all componets

### Dimensions/Duration
- dimensions of the work `Lenght x Width x Height cm`
- if its a performance or video piece name the `duration in minutes`
- if exits name type (e.g wood), dimesions and weight of the transport crates `Lenght x Width x Height cm` + `KG`

### Spatial Requirements
- how much floor/wall space is needed? `Lengt x Width m ` + `m²` 
- Does it need a separate room? 
- Does the work go well with daylight?
- or does it need a blackout room?
- wall color? `RAL <number>` [overview](https://www.ral-farben.de/en/all-ral-colours)

  - plug system? [Schuko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuko), French, British, US
  - do you need [earthing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthing_system)/ground/[Schutzleiter](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzleiter)?
  - remember that’s not common outside of Europe, North America, and parts of East Asia)
  - [example of a not so well done mains power extension](https://photos.app.goo.gl/xEAfmE82VwtSfs2R7)

- best is to name the exact model. Looks professional, but in most cases, you get something else ;(

### Consumables
- do you need consumables for the installation?
- things that can't be shipped because they are marked as dangerous? e.g chemicals, gasses etc
- e.g. cable ties?

### Componets (technological and others) to be provided by the Artist (shipped)
- make a list of all components (eventually document every single part/element photographically)
- parts/packing list are often requires for custom declartions 

### Lighting
- what kind of light setting is required for optimal presentation. spots, wall washer, profiles?

### Sound / Audio
- is it a loud piece?
- does it interfere with surrounding works?
- does it needs its own acoustic space?


### Transport Requirements
- consider different transport option
- try to make packaging small and light
- in general, transport is covered by the exhibitor
- build crates (only sometimes comes by the exhibitor)
- make them ready for international shipping ( ISPM 15)
- check custom situation for countries outside EU / maybe a [Carnet ATA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATA_Carnet) (passport for goods is needed)


### Setup / Installation
- how long do you need for the installation
- do you have to do the installation by yourself?
- do you need an assisting person for the installation, and for how long?
- materials like tools, monitor, tables, charis needed for the installation preocess.


### Maintenance
- what is needed to run the installation over a longer period? Wear of materials? cleaning?
- make a manual for the task.
- eventually, train a staff member of the institution.

### Operation Manual
- how to turn the piece on and off?
- define the order in which the different parts are started.
- how to fix common errors?
- another chapter is usability: make it easy for the staff (that might not be technically skilled) to start and stop the work. make autostart scripts, autologin, etc.


### Dismantling and Packing Guide
- make a detailed packing guide to make sure nothing gets broken while dismantling it.
