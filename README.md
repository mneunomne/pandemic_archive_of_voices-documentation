## The Archive
 
The Pandemic Archive of Voices is an audio archive constituted by 24 different speakers who contributed 185 audios in 18 different languages. Each of these audios represents a word or expression in the speaker's native language that would translate their own individual experience of the current context of the pandemic.
 
### Telegram group 

![Telegram Group](./images/archive-screenshot.jpg)
 
The first collection of these audios was made possible through a telegram group, where each participant was invited to collaborate sending audio messages together with their written form to the telegram group.

### Online form

For the installation to be displayed to the public, an online form was developed to make an independent form of audio contribution:

## The Installation
 
The idea of designing an audio-visual installation came from both the result of the development of the [Audio Piece](https://www.mixcloud.com/soundstudies/modulation-18-alberto-harres/) and the simulations experiments, where it became clear that *spatiality* was a central aspect of how this Archive could manifest itself in an empathetic way. For that matter I invited the collaboration of (Chi Him Chik)[], a fellow student of the Digital Media Master Program, who became responsible for the Sound Design of the installation, together with the general concept of its display.
 
The installation developed into a first prototype which comprised of an 8 channel audio installation with video mapping comprising of 3 programatic layers:
 
### Controller API (Processing)
 
API with a Graphical User Interface controlling the general *orchestration* of the archive in the installation, controlling the movement of each "virtual body", the amount of speaking voices, the distance from the center point, and set scenes and transitions between states.

### Spatial Audio (MAX/MSP)
 
Using [SPAT](https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/spat/), Chi Him developed the software that took the voices and movements data coming from the API and played them in a virtual space which simulates the audible spatial experience with multi-channel audio systems.

### Visual Projection (Projection)

Rendered the textual form of the played audios in a circular manner, respecting the same position where the audio is being played from in the spatial setup.

### Abstract
 
```
The living body is the central object of all politics.
```
*Paul B. Preciado, Learning from the Virus*

The installation presents a dynamic archive of voices as an audio-visual experience, an algorithmic mantra, seeking to create a meditative space of communion during this time of collective struggle. This pandemic archive of voices seeks to capture fragments of voices gravitating the current context of the pandemic, putting in perspective the diversity of cultures, backgrounds and language by which this global event can be seen through. This installation is produced as a language-specific experience. Through the exploration of interaction and collisions between sounds, images, and shapes of different languages, an abstract environment is formed orbiting the uncertainty of our present time.


### Simulation
